i was writing more REU apps and i went to save my work for one
and i click the big save button and it tells me to Log in
and all of my writing is gone.

this has happened to me before but i think what really
hurt about this one was that i could have saved it.
i clicked the button but i had Inspect Element open (because
i was using it like a calculator) and I already had the networking tab.

i could have saved my application. but instead. i closed the tab Right after.
the universe is uncaring

from [2025-01-14](/grievance/2025-01-14), I made the thing that pings me on discord every day
(which has been working so far) ping me at 4am because i'm running this on a server not in my timezone
so i would use discord, and i would see the red `NEW` notification at the bottom. every time i would
read the message i felt like a bird running straight into a window. then i would click "Mark as Unread"
and the vicious cycle would continue again. i'll let future me consider this a problem
